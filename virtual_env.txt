A virtual environment in Python is a tool for dependency management and project isolation. It creates an isolated space for projects, allowing them to have their own dependencies without interfering with each other or the system's global Python installation. This prevents conflicts between different project requirements.

To create a virtual environment, you can use the built-in venv module in Python 3.3 or later.
Code

python -m venv <environment_name>
Replace <environment_name> with the desired name for your environment (e.g., .venv, myenv). 
This command creates a directory containing a copy of the Python interpreter and the pip package installer.
To activate the virtual environment, use the appropriate command for your operating system: Linux/macOS.
Code

source <environment_name>/bin/activate
Windows.
Code

<environment_name>\Scripts\activate
Once activated, the environment name will appear in parentheses at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that you are working within the virtual environment.
You can then install packages using pip, and they will be installed only within the virtual environment, isolated from other projects and the system environment.
Code

pip install <package_name>
To deactivate the virtual environment, simply type deactivate in the command prompt.
